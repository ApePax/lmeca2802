# ü§ñ Pheidippides

Philippideis is a project focused on **abstraction-based control** for a **5-link planar robot**, implemented using [Dionysos.jl](https://github.com/julienCalbert/Dionysos.jl).

This repository includes multiple simulation environments based on both **JuliaRobotics** and **Robotran**. It features a position control only environments to reproduce gaits with position trajectories. It also explores abstraction-based control synthesis using **Dionysos.jl**, developed by Julien Calbert.

## üìå Requirements

- Linux
- Git
- Julia (recommended version: 1.10.2)
- Robotran (for C/Python-based simulations)

## üì• Installation

First create a folder in your home directory: <br>
```bash
mkdir .robotran
cd .robotran
```
Then in this directory, download [Robotran](https://www.robotran.be/download/), the MBSysC and the MBSysPad, as well as the python package MBSysPy (follow the instruction provided in the [Installation Instructions](https://robotran-doc.git-page.immc.ucl.ac.be/Installation-Instruction/Linux/#))
).

In the same repository, clone the git:

```bash
git pull
```



## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `Dionysos.jl/`: Library for abstraction-based controller synthesis, developed by **Julien Calbert**.
- `JuliaRobotics/`: Simulates the robot using motor position control, solved with **JuliaRobotics**.
- `Robotran_c/` and `Robotran_py/`: Similar simulations to `JuliaRobotics/` using **Robotran** instead.
- `Robotran_J2C/`: A modified version of `Robotran_c` adapted for integration with **Dionysos.jl**.



## üí° More Specifically

### 1. Position Control Environments

This chapter covers basic position control simulations for the 5-link planar robot. This position controller is included in the Dynamixels motors by the manufacturer:<br>
<img src=".README/IMAGES/DXL_controller_implemented.png" alt="DXL Position controller" width="600"/> <br>
The controller outputs a tension, which is converted to torque using the following DC motor model (at the motor level): <br>
$$\tau = k'_t u_a - (\tau_c + K'_v \dot{q})$$ <br>
The implemented formula is slightly different as the torques need to be at the joint levels, introducing the gear ratios in the formula.

#### 1.1 JuliaRobotics
The folder `JuliaRobotics/` contains the simulation environment of Pheidippideis using JuliaRobotics, and is divided into four folders:
- `deps/`: contains the simulation results.
- `deps/`: contains the URDF.
- `Simulator/`: contains the code. `RobotSimulator.jl/` contains all the specific functions (ground contact, controllers, ...), while `simulation_controller.jl/` runs the code.
- `WalkingPatterns/`: contains the position trajectories to follow. <br>

The codes allows to either use the position controller (data_from_WP = true) or to directly apply voltages (data_from_WP = false). To run the code :
```bash
julia
;
cd JuliaRobotics/
(suppr key to come back)
]
activate .
update
instantiate
(suppr key to come back)
include("Simulator/simulation_controller.jl")
exit()
```
As explained in our master thesis, feeding the voltages measured on the physical robot in open-loop does not work in the current state, as the simulation is not able to reproduce the ZMP trajectory.

#### 1.2 Robotran
The folders `Robotran_c/` and `Robotran_py/` follow a similar implementation to `JuliaRobotics/`, but uses MBS files instead of URDF. The python version is used for feature development dur to is ease for debugging, while the c implementation is used for its computation speed capabilities. Both implementations follow the same structure. The main folders are:
- `dataR/`
- `resultR/`
- `symbolicR/`
- `userfctR/`
- `WalkingPatterns/`
- `workR/`



### 2. Abstraction-Based Control Environments

This chapter covers advanced control using state-space abstraction and controller synthesis.

#### 2.1 JuliaRobotics + Dionysos.jl

- Leverages `Dionysos.jl` for abstraction-based synthesis.
- Potential integration with JuliaRobotics for simulation (to be detailed if implemented).

#### 2.2 Robotran + Dionysos.jl (`philippides_J2C`)

- Combines Robotran dynamics with `Dionysos.jl` for controller synthesis.
- `philippides_J2C` acts as the bridge between the dynamic model and the abstract controller.
